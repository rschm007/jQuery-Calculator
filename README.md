This webapp was designed as part of the UCI Web Development Bootcamp.

This app uses jQuery and the Moment.js library to allow a user to save events for each hour of the day in a neatly organized table. The table rows change color depending upon if the hour is in the past, present, or future. 

The project has been deployed to GitHub pages. To use the app you can follow the deployment link or download the source files for you to use as a template.


Prerequisites
-----------------------------

To install this application you will need a text editor like Visual Studio Code.


Summary
-----------------------------

The user is presented with a page containing a header with  the current date, a "clear all text" button, and then a series of labeled rows.

The user is able to enter in their own text within each row.

Upon clicking the save button, the user's input is saved in localStorage and will persist through page resets.

Should the user want to reset their text, they can click the "Clear All Text" button to clear the localStorage and the text field values. The fields will then reset to show that they are empty.

The rows will dynamically change color based upon what time it currently is. Grey marks the past, red the present, and green the future.
